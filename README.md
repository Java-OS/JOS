<h3 style="text-align: center">JVM/Linux Operating System</h2>    
This is a new idea and the first version of Java-based operating system.      
This operating system is designed and implemented to run Java projects based on the `Java platform modular system (JPMS)`.      
In this operating system, there is no news of the `GNU` project anymore, and all control and management of the operating system is done through `Java`.        
**Note:** The init program is rewritten with `rust` programming language.     

### License 
This operating system distributed under GPL v2 license,     
**Note:** You have to pay for access to the source code.
